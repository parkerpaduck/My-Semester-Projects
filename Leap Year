### Project 4: Leap Year Checker
**Summary**: This program allows to check for rules and conditions regarding leap years.
**Key Features**: 
- I was able to tell the function a set of rules, and the function ran and determined which years were leap years.
- Checked for divisibility

def is_leap_year(year):
    if year % 400 == 0:
        return True
    if year % 100 == 0:
        return False
    if year % 4 == 0:
        return True
    return False

# Test cases
print(is_leap_year(2024))  
print(is_leap_year(1900))
print(is_leap_year(1600))
